# StdDrawPractice
Lab to practice using the StdDraw class as well as other libraries in the stanford lib

To find the source code for the stanford libraries go to: http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

The source files are well documented and have pretty clear instructions on how to use them in the block comments at the top.
The class we will be using priomarily is StdDraw but you may use any of the classes in this library in your project.  To import classes using this library use:

import edu.princeton.cs.introcs.*;

This will import all classes in the library.  Alternatively you can import a single class by replacing the * in the command above with the name of the class you want to import.  There is no real benefit to only importing one class though.
